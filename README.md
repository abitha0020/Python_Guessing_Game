# Python_Guessing_Game

The Guessing Game is a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) application built using the
breezypythongui library in Python. It challenges the user to guess a randomly generated number
between 1 and 100, providing immediate feedback on whether the guess is too low, too high, or
correct. The interface includes an instruction label at the top, an entry widget for inputting
guesses, a button to submit guesses, and labels to display the result and the number of attempts
made. Additionally, a button to start a new game becomes available after correctly guessing the
number. The GUI elements are neatly arranged using a grid layout, with the sticky="NSEW"
parameter ensuring that the widgets expand appropriately to fill the cells, making the interface
responsive and visually appealing. The application initializes the game variables upon startup,
checks the user's guess and updates the interface accordingly, and resets the game when starting a
new round. This interactive game provides an engaging experience for users, combining
simplicity with functionality.
